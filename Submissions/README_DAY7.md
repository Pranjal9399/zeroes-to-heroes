# Day 7 – Advanced Debugging & Code Understanding (JavaScript)

This task focuses on moving beyond basic syntax and understanding how JavaScript code should be written in a clean, structured, and reliable way.

The goal was to debug a broken even–odd checker and then improve it into a more realistic solution. Instead of writing logic in the global scope, the final solution uses a function-based approach with proper input validation.

The program safely converts input values, checks whether the input is a valid integer, and returns accurate results for even, odd, and invalid cases. This reflects how real-world JavaScript code is written with clarity and reusability in mind.

## Key Learnings
- Importance of validating input before applying logic  
- Writing reusable functions instead of one-time scripts  
- Using strict checks to avoid unexpected behavior  
- Thinking like a developer, not just a coder  

This exercise helped strengthen problem-solving skills and improved overall code quality.
