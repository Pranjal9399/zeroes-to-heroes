# Day 4 – SQL Basics

This task is part of **Day 4** of the Zeroes to Heroes challenge and focuses on understanding the basics of SQL.

In this task, I practiced creating a table, inserting data, retrieving records, applying conditions, updating values, and deleting records using SQL queries. Bonus queries include sorting data and filtering records using an email domain.

## Topics Covered
- Creating tables using CREATE TABLE  
- Inserting records with INSERT  
- Fetching data using SELECT  
- Filtering data using WHERE  
- Updating records using UPDATE  
- Deleting records using DELETE  
- Sorting results with ORDER BY  
- Filtering emails using LIKE  

The queries were executed using an online SQL compiler for learning and practice purposes.

This task helped strengthen my understanding of how databases work and how data is managed using SQL.
